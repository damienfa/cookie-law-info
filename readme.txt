A simple way to ensure your website complies with the EU Cookie Law, which comes into force from 26 May 2012.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a subtle, non-disruptive banner to your website header to highlight your compliance status regarding the new EU Cookie Law.
Inline with current industry best practice (May 2012) and unlike some other plugins, this is non-disruptive i.e. it doesn't make your visitors take action before they use your website. This is aimed at reducing website visitor dropout.

Features:

* Fully customisable dropdown header: colours, styles
* Website visitors can dismiss the message, so that will not be shown again (uses a cookie)
* Shortcode to allow visitor to delete that cookie
* Able to switch on/off without having to disable plugin

Coming soon:

* Shortcode to construct a nicely-styled 'Privacy & Cookie Policy'
* Language translations
* New fonts, styles and animations
* Option to show in footer

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the EU Cookie Law? =
Under new EU privacy regulations, websites must make it clear to visitors what information about them is being stored. This specifically includes cookies. Even if cookies do not store information identifying an individual, you must still provide your visitor with information on what is being stored, by whom, what for, and so on.
Certain cooies are exempt from this- those deemed to be "strictly necessary" (e.g. WordPress stores session cookies for authentication, without these it wouldn't work) however cookies stored by analytics software like Google Analytics do not fall into this category.
See www.cookielawinfo.com for more information.

= I'm not a UK/EU citizen, how on earth can this apply to me? =
If you have a significant proportion of visitors from the EU then this law also applies to you.
See www.cookielawinfo.com for more information.

= My website is not hosted in the UK/EU, am I exempt? =
No. The law is about protecting the privacy of UK/EU citizens, so if your website has a significant proportion of visitors from the EU then this law also applies to you.
See www.cookielawinfo.com for more information.

= The cookie law doesn't make much sense. How can we stop it? =
Just about everybody agrees with you. However it is here, it is law, and according to the Information Commissioner's Office (AKA 'the ICO') it will be enforced. We think it's best to take action to comply as well as petition. However there's no point just ignoring it, it is already here.

= How do I comply with the EU Cookie Law? =
There are various interpretations of the law within the industry, and as such there is no simple answer. But the main way to ensure you are not penalised is to make some attempt at complying- reviewing your cookie use then using a plugin like this one is a good first step.
See www.cookielawinfo.com for more information.

= The cookie header isn't displaying =
First check you have installed the plugin and have activated it in the plugins panel.
To check if it is switched on or not, go to 'Settings / Cookie Law Info' and then enable the header by setting 'Display cookie bar?' to 'yes'.

= Are there any aditional skins/styles available? =
There are more coming soon. In the mean time you can manually select your styles. If you're looking for inspiration, check out http://kuler.adobe.com.

= It would be great if your plugin also did XYZ =
Please email me and I'll consider adding that feature. It would be great to hear suggestions on how to improve it.

= The header doesn't work on <<< BROWSER X, Version Y, on Operating System Z >>> =
